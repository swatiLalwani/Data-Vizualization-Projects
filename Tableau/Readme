Summary of the COVID-19 Data Dashboard Project
This project presents an interactive COVID-19 Data Dashboard created using Tableau, showcasing global and regional insights into the pandemic's impact. It provides stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the pandemic's scale, trends, and variations across countries and continents.

Key Features:
Global Overview:

Total Cases: 77.2 million.
Total Deaths: 6.97 million.
Death Percentage: 0.903% globally, reflecting the severity of the pandemic.
Regional Breakdown:

Death Count Per Continent:
Europe reported the highest fatalities (over 2 million), followed by Asia and North America.
Africa and Oceania reported comparatively fewer deaths.
This visualization helps understand how the pandemic impacted different continents.
Geographic Insights:

Percent Population Infected Per Country:
A heatmap visually highlights countries with higher infection rates (up to 75.07%).
This allows quick identification of hotspots like the United States and Europe.
Trends Over Time:

Percent Population Infected:
A line chart depicts how infection rates evolved across major countries (e.g., the U.S., India, China, etc.) from 2020 to 2023.
The U.S. reached a peak infection rate of 30.41%, while China's rate remained significantly lower at 6.94%.
Key Achievements:
Comprehensive Analysis:

Successfully aggregated and visualized pandemic data at both global and regional levels.
Enabled comparative analysis across continents and countries.
Actionable Insights:

Identified regions with the highest infection and fatality rates for better resource allocation.
Provided a time-series analysis to track the progression of infections over the years.
Effective Use of Tableau:

Designed interactive dashboards with:
Heatmaps for geographical insights.
Bar and line charts for temporal and categorical data analysis.
Filters for dynamic exploration of the dataset.
Enhanced Decision-Making:

Empowered policymakers, health organizations, and researchers to understand the pandemic’s trajectory and plan interventions accordingly.
Conclusion:
This COVID-19 Dashboard demonstrates the power of data visualization in summarizing complex datasets into actionable insights. It showcases Swati’s ability to integrate data analysis with storytelling, making it an invaluable tool for stakeholders navigating the global health crisis.
